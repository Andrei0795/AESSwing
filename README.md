# AESSwing

Recently I have been revising for the Cryptography exams and learnt more about algorithms used in Ciphers to encrypt and decrypt texts. AES stands for the Advanced Encryption Standard and it is one of my favourite algorithms. 

I have created a little Java app that helps encrypt and decrypt texts using a password. 

To run it, one can open the **AESSwing.jar** file provided in the directory. To compile the files, go to the directory and simply run **javac \*.java** and then run **java AESSwing.java**. I haven't used any IDEs for this app, just my basic knowledge from 1st year of uni and the AES algorithm. 

To use the app you need to provide a text to encrypt/decrypt and a passowrd. This password we can assume you secretly send to someone who has the app as well to decrypt your messages. If for decrpytion, a different wrong passowrd is entered, the decrypted text will not show up.
